In the wish that someone will prepare a similar list for other tech stacks I may want to learn, I will leave here references which helped me speed up the process of learning python. 

The amount of good resources are overwhelming for a new joiner, therefore I always find it useful to at least have a few starting points.

This list is still in progress and will be updated with all the good resources I can find. Please feel free to share
