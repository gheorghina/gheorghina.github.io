Hi everyone

I am Gheorghina, a passionate technical lead and coach with over nine years of experience in creating integration, backend and web enterprise software applications while helping other colleagues grow. 

I have expertise in Microsoft.Net, JavaScript and MS SQL technologies that were used in the home automation and in the pharmaceutical businesses. 

In the last couple of years I focused my activities in the Software Architecture area, but then I decided to broaden my technical expertise, so I went back on being a novice. 

Nowadays I am working a lot with in Elixir, AWS solutions and Terraform.

In this blog I will mainly keep my notes but I will also try to write advices and recommendations that may also help you.


Thank you!
