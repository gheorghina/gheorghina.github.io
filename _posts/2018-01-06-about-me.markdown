Hi everyone

For those who don't know me, my name is Gheorghina.

I am passionate .net technical lead and coach with over nine years of experience in creating integration, backend and web enterprise software applications while helping other colleagues grow. 

I have expertise in Microsoft.Net, JavaScript and MS SQL technologies that were used in the home automation and in the pharmaceutical businesses.

In the last couple of years I focused my activities also in the Solution Architecture area.

So in this blog I will mainly keep my notes but I will also try to write advices and recommendations that might also help you.



Thank you!
