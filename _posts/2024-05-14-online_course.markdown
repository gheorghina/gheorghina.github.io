I am excited to introduce my new educational services designed to elevate expertise in enterprise architecture with two programs:
an Online Course in Enterprise Architecture and an engaging Enterprise Architecture Case Study Workshop. 

Both offerings leverage the globally recognized TOGAF framework and include real-world applications, ensuring practical knowledge that can be applied immediately in professional settings.
