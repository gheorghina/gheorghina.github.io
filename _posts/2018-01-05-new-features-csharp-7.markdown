Here you can find a summary of the most important features that were released with c# 7.

This summary was made mainly for myself as a go to place in case I want to remember what I read.

The resources I recommend for having each item described in detail are the following:

   [Pluralsight course on  C# 7: First Look]:https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/csharp-7-first-look by mister [Jesse Liberty]:https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/jesse-liberty

## Tuples

The code written with tuples in previous .net frameworks can become very verbose and difficult to comprehend.  Therefore a few improvements were done in c# 7 to overcome this.

Examples with tuples used as return values as literals and with named values:
