This article is dedicated to all my coder fellows who ask me what is that magic liquor I am drinking these days, and to all those out there being afraid to try the leap of transitioning from their language of choice to Elixir, by thinking they will become less relevant on the workforce market.
 
Beware my friends, next time you ask me about Elixir, Absinthe or any other magic cocktail I will just provide a link.
 
So this is my journey on transitioning from C# to Elixir.
But if I think deeply, there is no such thing as transitioning completely from one language to another. It is more about expanding your knowledge as a developer, which I encourage everyone to do, and then be able to use one or the other as they are a better fit.
 
Some people advise on learning one new language every year, but this might be a bit extreme if you are like me wanting to know the insights well enough to be able to provide solutions fit for the business.It can take up to several weeks to learn a new language, but this in my opinion implies only knowing how to code in it.
 
If you want to go further, deeper into the rabbit hole, then for sure there are more factors to it. From knowing how to code in a language and be able to design features means making one leap further to understanding different solution variations with their pros and cons.
For this, you need the context, the people, the books, the time, the patience and the brain.
 
After 10 years of providing Microsoft Solutions for Enterprise Businesses, I needed a change. 
At that time I did not know exactly what Elixir or Erlang is, what power do they bring, what difference do they make. I just had this huge opportunity, that through a thorough interview process I was accepted in a team. They worked on a project written in Elixir which was used for Chat and Events Streaming between multiple systems.
 
When I decided to accept the job, my eagerness started to grow, but also my anxiety. Just so you know, in Cluj Napoca(Romania), where I am from, there are only two companies working with Elixir at the time of writing this article, out of which only one has a complex, heavily utilised production system. 
So it was not like I had many options where to go and ask. 

What do you do in this situation? 

Well, you just start digging the internet, do tons of research for gathering insights and learning materials and try to see if other people went through the same transition or if you are all alone. 

I added at the end of this article a link to another post I made with resources which helped me a lot during the process. Some of them I am still using today and will continue to use as long as I will work with the around the BEAM tech stack.

Therefore, in the next lines I will try to cover the questions I had in the beginning as a C#, OOP programmer. 

I will not write about which of the two is better, since both serve very well different purposes. 

I will go through some of the differences, similarities, strengths and weaknesses I found through my subjective eyes, things that made a difference for me in how I think and approach things.    


### What is it?

[Elixir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_(programming_language)) is a dynamic, functional programming language created by Jos√© Valim. It is built on top of [Erlang Virtual Machine called BEAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)). 
It is used when robust, fault tolerant, highly distributed systems are required.  

The way I started viewing it, when I began, was that Elixir was developed for poor programmers like me, to be able to quickly grasp it and implement powerfull systems on top of BEAM which otherwise would not have been achieved since Erlang falls at the bottom of the popularity charts.

### Conclusion


With this blog post, I just wanted to let others know they are not alone. 
There are others like you switching to Elixir. Have no fear, be eager and open to learn new things. Be curious and then good things will happen to you. 

There are only advantages to knowing, understanding more languages. 
It will make you a better craftsman who will have less chances of falling under the ["Hammer law"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument) 


### Some Resources


[Elixir resources I put together](https://gheorghina.github.io/elixir/erlang/resources/2019/01/31/elixir-erlang-resources.html)


[C# vs Elixir discussion on the Elixir forum](https://elixirforum.com/t/elixir-vs-c/670/13) 


[Check what other people listed as pros and cons on both](https://www.slant.co/versus/115/1540/~c_vs_elixir) and maybe [this one](http://vschart.com/compare/elixir/vs/c-sharp)


[Ease the fear of loosing your relevance](http://devonestes.com/the-truth-about-hiring) and [this one for jobs openings.](https://functional.works-hub.com/jobs/)  --- but if you start searching you will see there are more and more companies realising the value the BEAM VM brings and are slowly staring to migrate their solutions.
