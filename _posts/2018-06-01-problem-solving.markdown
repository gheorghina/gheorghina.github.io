Based on the following anonymous quote: 

    "I am not sure about how you do it, but when I have to take a decision, I first analyze it, I evaluate the risk, I take actions for limiting the bad consequences and only after that I screw it up"

### Context

For a good amount of years I have been exposed to the context of having to prepare technical concepts for new potential products.

That means transforming the whishes of a potential customer into concrete technical actions with a realistic evaluation of complexity, as much as it could be at the moment of evaluation.  

After doing it for a couple of times I decided to document my thinking process and to also do some workshops with my fellow colleagues for knowledge dissemination and teaching purposes.

That being said, I long cycle of workshops took place over 2 years, where I tried to transform a very scary mythical process into some concrete recipe as a guideline.


### Disclaimer

As I worked in both big and small companies, I can say for sure, that the following strategy can be unnecessary and to heavy in some context.
Depending on the degree of the complexity of the problem, the relationships between involved parties, and the required detailed level for the pitch, what I am about to present can be tailored from taking it fully, to just brush through some concepts or skip it all together. 
 
Therefore, please take everything bellow with a grain of salt as it was meant only as being a guideline for a very well defined context which might not apply to you. Use filters to choose anything you might find useful for you.
