Based on the following anonymous quote: 

    "I am not sure about how you do it, but when I have to take a decision, I first analyze it, I evaluate the risk, I take actions for limiting the bad consequences and only after that I screw it up"

### Context

For a good amount of years I have been exposed to the context of having to prepare technical concepts for new potential products.

That means transforming the whishes of a potential customer into concrete technical actions with a realistic evaluation of complexity, as much as it could be at the moment of evaluation.  

After doing it for a couple of times I decided to document my thinking process and to also do some workshops with my fellow colleagues for knowledge dissemination and teaching purposes.

That being said, I long cycle of workshops took place over 2 years, where I tried to transform a very scary mythical process into some concrete recipe as a guideline.


### Disclaimer

As I worked in both big and small companies, I can say for sure, that the following strategy can be unnecessary and to heavy in some context.
Depending on the degree of the complexity of the problem, the relationships between involved parties, and the required detailed level for the pitch, what I am about to present can be tailored from taking it fully, to just brush through some concepts or skip it all together. 
 
Therefore, please take everything bellow with a grain of salt as it was meant only as being a guideline for a very well defined context which might not apply to you. Use filters to choose anything you might find useful for you.


### Phase 1 - Requirements Gathering

This is the easiest part, right? Anyone can listen wishes patiently and ask some questions, isn't it?

Well, yes, if you know what you are looking for. 

#### Functional Requirements

The easiest and obvious part in requirements gathering phase is understanding the Functional Requirements. They are easy to spot, as stakeholders who are unfamiliar with the development process will come to you with a pouring rain containing details, dreams and ideas. 

Like for example: I am the mayor of the most futuristic city on the planet. I need an intelligent traffic control & monitoring system.

A couple of advices I would have for the functional requirements are the following:

    - try not to miss any one - this shows you listen, care and understand the need

    - try to simplify/reduce them - try to understand via questions if there is openness to alternatives, or if the requests are fixed and rigid

    - try to identify what would be the subset which would bring most value - this would later help you prepare the concepts for the MVP related subset, growing everything from there incrementally 


#### Non Functional Requirements
