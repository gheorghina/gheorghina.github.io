Even though I successfully completed The Open Group Certified: TOGAF® Enterprise Architecture Foundation and Practitioner certifications, I hesitated to share this achievement publicly. Why might that be?

Could it be due to the awareness that a significant portion of my network might disapprove? Perhaps the highly technical individuals, the proficient coders, who prioritize pragmatic solutions and harbor a disdain for architectural frameworks and extensive documentation, considering them incompatible with agility?

Alternatively, is it possible that my reluctance stems from personal biases and a critical eye? Could it be that I resist the idea of investing time in what I perceive as dull materials instead of engaging in the more dynamic activity of writing some code?

## On Human Nature 

Why should I concern myself with either of the two perspectives mentioned above? The yin and yang of my brain are fighting each other.

On one side, acknowledging that:

*"Humans are, by nature, social animals. That's why we care what others think of us: We want to belong, to be accepted, and to bond with other members of our social "pack." Caring about other people's opinions of us is a survival mechanism as old as humanity itself"[[williamsburgtherapygroup]](https://williamsburgtherapygroup.com/blog/why-do-i-care-so-much-what-other-people-think)*

Contrasted by my internal muse insisting: 

*"I do not care what other people think of me. I do not think about it. I really don't care. I wouldn't change the way I dress, and I wouldn't change the way I think, and I wouldn't change the way I act. I am what I am, and I'm going to continue to be that way." - Richard Feynman*

and...

*"Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible." - Richard Feynman*

With this backdrop, let's refocus and delve into the following points:

1. Stereotypes and Preconceptions
2. What's in it for me? What can be in it for you?
3. An honest opinion weather the TOGAF® Enterprise Architecture certification worth it?
4. Can you pass the exams by memorizing the answers from the practice tests? 
5. How can you prepare for the exams?


## Stereotypes and Preconceptions, Twisted Brains

I began with a sense of unease about publicly sharing my achievement in passing the TOGAF® Enterprise Architecture certification, primarily driven by concerns within my network. 

However, recalling the wisdom of my favorite teacher, Richard Feynman, who emphasized, *"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool,"* I confronted the truth — it was largely my own preconceptions influencing my reservations.

I started the journey with a critical and a very skeptical eye. I was sure this is all about processes invented by group of detached decision-makers sitting in ivory towers, dictating solution architectures to the poor developers, who are not allowed to think for themselves, forcing stakeholders to sign off on documents they do not understand, and so on.

I was wrong.

I was in the middle of a training, not paying attention, just hoping my brain will absorb what I deemed to be impractical ideas, anticipating a I will be magically able to understand ideas followed by a swift forgetting thereafter. 

Engaging in practice exercises with this mindset, I approached them as an experiment, ultimately leading to failure. My distorted thought process had me selecting options based on a stereotype I had constructed: *What would a group of detached decision-makers, proficient only in Excel and PowerPoint, orchestrating mandates from their ivory tower onto the less fortunate do in this situation?*

And then I failed successfully ...


## What's in it for me? What can be in it for you?

Let's keep this short.

By nature, the projects I was leading in the last 8 years were no joke, in terms of size, impact and complexity.

As a Software Engineer at my core, I am deeply invested in honing my craft. I do want to practice and get better at driving complex architectural changes, which can bring value to the customer, and which would not leave victims behind, but rather bring everyone on the same boat, fighting for the same goal, learning as they go and having fun while doing it.

I care a lot about learning from mistakes and be able to replicate successes by being able to pin point exactly what worked, what didn't and why. Over the course of 16 years in the industry, I've cultivated my own frameworks, methodologies, and tailoring mechanisms, drawing from experiences with RUP and SDP.

I do read a lot, I do practice a lot, I do fail a lot, I do learn a lot. Despite being aware of TOGAF, I had consistently dismissed the idea of exploring it.

In essence, my interest lies not only in Enterprise Architecture but, more significantly, in elevating my craft. I seek professional feedback on my methodologies, aspiring to learn from those who navigate intricate projects while upholding core principles. My goal is to enhance my ability to replicate successes.

To underscore my perspective, I turn to a couple of renowned quotes:

"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." - Sir Isaac Newton

"Innovation is the result of a collaborative effort, not of isolated individuals." - Grace Murray Hopper


## An honest opinion weather it is worthed to check the TOGAF® ?

Before I proceed with the classical "it depends", let's get together on some common ground, and then let you answer the question further.


### What is an Enterprise as per TOGAF? 

In The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF), an "enterprise" is a comprehensive entity that goes beyond the boundaries of a single organization. It is defined as any collection of organizations that has a common set of goals and is created to produce a product or deliver a service. It includes people, processes, business capabilities, information, and technology. The term "enterprise" in TOGAF is not limited to a single organization; it can encompass multiple organizations that collaborate to achieve a common set of objectives.

The suitability of The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) depends on the specific context and needs of an organization.


### Why would one need Enterprise Architecture?

In The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF), the EA is a strategic asset that helps an organization achieve its business goals. 

- It help achieving a balance between business transformation and operational efficiency.
- It facilitates governance, risk management and exploitation of opportunities
- It directs and controls the change activity
- It provides a strategic context for the evolution of the enterprise.


### How can one judge if this complexity can fit a specific organization?

I am listing here some scenarios in which the framework can be suitable, and feel free to judge for yourself:

- *Large and Complex Organizations*: TOGAF is well-suited for large enterprises with complex structures, diverse business units, and extensive IT landscapes. The framework provides a structured methodology for managing complexity and aligning business and IT objectives.

- *Industry Standards and Compliance*: In industries where there are established standards and compliance requirements for enterprise architecture, TOGAF can be a valuable tool. It aligns with industry best practices and provides a common language for architecture development.

- *Enterprise-wide Transformation*: Organizations undergoing significant transformations, such as mergers, acquisitions, or large-scale technology changes, can benefit from TOGAF. The framework provides a systematic approach to aligning business and IT strategies during periods of change.

- *Consistent Architecture Approach*: If an organization seeks a standardized approach to architecture development, TOGAF offers a comprehensive and systematic methodology. This can help ensure consistency in how architectures are designed, documented, and implemented across the enterprise.

- *Long-term Planning*: TOGAF supports long-term planning by providing a structured approach to developing and managing enterprise architectures. It helps organizations create a roadmap for future developments and ensures that these developments align with business goals.

- *Stakeholder Communication*: TOGAF emphasizes the importance of stakeholder engagement and communication. In contexts where there are numerous stakeholders with diverse interests, TOGAF can help facilitate communication and ensure that everyone is aligned with the enterprise's goals.

- *IT Governance*: Organizations that prioritize effective IT governance can find TOGAF beneficial. The framework provides governance structures and processes to ensure that IT initiatives align with business strategies and comply with organizational policies.

- *Training and Skill Development*: If an organization is committed to developing a workforce with skills in enterprise architecture, TOGAF provides a widely recognized certification program. This can be valuable for individuals and organizations seeking to enhance their architecture capabilities.


## Can you pass the exams by memorizing the answers from the practice tests? 

Continuing on the same comical and ignorant manner, mirroring the preconceptions I describe  earlier, I initially believed that obtaining the TOGAF certification would be a swift checkbox on my CV—an item to be completed and promptly forgotten.

I was wrong.

In brief, while it's feasible to pass the exam with about a month of dedicated effort, there's no shortcut involving memorizing questions and answers.

The exam has to parts: 

1. **Theoretical Part**: Featuring 40 questions, some of which may resemble those found in practice tests. However, I can assure you that merely relying on these won't guarantee a 100% success rate. You need to understand the logic of the framework, and you need to understand the context in which the questions are asked.  It's deceptively easy to mix and match answers.

2. **Practical Part**: Comprising 8 complex questions, this section presents you with scenarios. This is an open book exam, in which the course material as added as support. This is the part where you cannot rely on memorization. You need to understand the concepts, and you need to understand the context in which they are applied.

In essence, the TOGAF certification isn't a mere checkbox; it demands a genuine grasp of the framework's intricacies and the ability to navigate real-world scenarios.


## How can you prepare for the exams?

As each person learns differently, you can choose:

- online trainings, learning at your own pace, but be aware, they will mainly read the framework for you, no further explanations ex: [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/togaf-10-practitioner/learn/lecture/41159988?start=1#overview)

- reading the materials from the Open Group website: [TOGAF Library](https://publications.opengroup.org/togaf-library)

- investing in a more expensive training, with an accredited trainer, and with a group of people, which can be more engaging, letting someone else structure and highlight the information for you, ex: [Advised skills](https://www.advisedskills.com/)

- practice tests, which can be found online on [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/togaf-practice-test/) or [examtopics](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/the-open-group/)


## Ending Note

Concluding on a positive note, I found it pleasantly surprising that TOGAF does not impose rigid waterfall processes, lofty ivory towers, prescriptive solution mandates, burdensome documentation, extensive procedures, or overbearing governance.

Instead, it revolves around common sense and the flexibility to tailor the framework according to individual needs.

Motivated by this realization, I've chosen to share my personal experience and reflections on the subject. Whether this information proves beneficial for you is entirely at your discretion. You are the best judge of your context and requirements.
