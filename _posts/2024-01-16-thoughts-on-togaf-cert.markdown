Even though I passed successfully the The Open Group Certified: TOGAF® Enterprise Architecture Foundation and Practitioner certifications, I wanted to restrain myself from making it public. Why can that be? 


Can it be because I know half of my network would disapprove of it? The super smart part of it, the heavy coders, focusing on getting things done, disliking the idea of any architecture or the idea of having any diagrams and documentations preceding or accompanying their code, disqualifying them as non agile? 

Or can it be because of my personal preconceptions and critical eyes? Of not wanting to waste time on boring materials, instead of writing some code?

## On Human Nature 

Why would I care of any of the two from above? The yin and yang of my brain are fighting each other.

On one side, by saying:

    "Humans are, by nature, social animals. That's why we care what others think of us: We want to belong, to be accepted, and to bond with other members of our social "pack." Caring about other people's opinions of us is a survival mechanism as old as humanity itself"[[williamsburgtherapygroup]](https://williamsburgtherapygroup.com/blog/why-do-i-care-so-much-what-other-people-think)

And on the other side by having my muse whispering: 

    "I do not care what other people think of me. I do not think about it. I really don't care. I wouldn't change the way I dress, and I wouldn't change the way I think, and I wouldn't change the way I act. I am what I am, and I'm going to continue to be that way." - Richard Feynman

and...

    "Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible." - Richard Feynman

With the above long intro, I will try to bring you back and tackle the following points:

1. Stereotypes and Preconceptions
2. What's in it for me? What can be in it for you?
3. An honest opinion weather the TOGAF® Enterprise Architecture certification worth it?
4. Can you pass the exams by memorizing the answers from the practice tests? 
5. How can you prepare for the exams?


## Stereotypes and Preconceptions, Twisted Brains

I started by saying I am anxious about making it public that I passed the TOGAF® Enterprise Architecture certification due to my network. 

But quoting my favorite teacher again, he says: ""The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool." - Richard Feynman

Truth is it was mostly because of my own preconceptions.

I started the journey with a critical and a very skeptical eye. I was sure this is all about processes invented by middle men sitting in ivory towers, dictating solution architectures to the poor developers, who are not allowed to think for themselves, forcing stakeholders to sign off on documents they do not understand, and so on.

I was wrong.

I was in the middle of a training, not paying attention, just hoping my brain will absorb bullshit ideas and magically be able to understand, but then I will for sure ensure I will quickly forget everything.

I was doing the practice exercises with the above mindset, just to give it a try, and then I obviously failed. My twisted thought process was that I was choosing options based on the stereotype I created in my mind thinking from a 3rd person perspective: 

    What would a group of middle men doing only excel and powerpoints, sitting in an ivory tower, enforce on poor people in this situation?

And then I failed successfully ...


## What's in it for me? What can be in it for you?

Let's keep this short.

By nature, the projects I was leading in the last 8 years were no joke, in terms of size, impact and complexity.

I am a Software Engineer at core, so therefore I do care about my craft. I do want to practice and get better at driving complex architectural changes, which can bring value to the customer, and which would not leave victims behind, but rather bring everyone on the same boat, fighting for the same goal, learning as they go and having fun while doing it.

I care a lot about learning from mistakes and be able to replicate successes by being able to pin point exactly what worked and what didn't and why.

I have my own frameworks, approaches and tailoring mechanisms developed based on RUP, SDP and 16 years of being in the industry.

I do read a lot, I do practice a lot, I do fail a lot, I do learn a lot.

I did know about TOGAF, but I always rejected the thought of even looking at it. 

Long story short, I am interested in Enterprise Architecture, but even more than that, I am interested in getting better at my craft, in getting professional feedback on my own approaches. I want to learn from others who drive complex projects while respecting the above principles. I want to be better at replicating successes.

An here I throw some other famous quotes:

"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." - Sir Isaac Newton

"Innovation is the result of a collaborative effort, not of isolated individuals." - Grace Murray Hopper


## An honest opinion weather it is worthed to check the TOGAF® ?

Before I proceed with the classical "it depends", let's get together on some common ground, and then let you answer the question further.

### What is an Enterprise as per TOGAF? 

In The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF), an "enterprise" is a comprehensive entity that goes beyond the boundaries of a single organization. It is defined as any collection of organizations that has a common set of goals and is created to produce a product or deliver a service. It includes people, processes, business capabilities, information, and technology. The term "enterprise" in TOGAF is not limited to a single organization; it can encompass multiple organizations that collaborate to achieve a common set of objectives.

The suitability of The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) depends on the specific context and needs of an organization.

### Why would one need Enterprise Architecture?

In The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF), the EA is a strategic asset that helps an organization achieve its business goals. 

- It help achieving a balance between business transformation and operational efficiency.
- It facilitates governance, risk management and exploitation of opportunities
- It directs and controls the change activity
- It provides a strategic context for the evolution of the enterprise.

### How can one judge if this complexity can fit a specific organization?

I am listing here some scenarios in which the framework can be suitable, and feel free to judge for yourself:

- *Large and Complex Organizations*: TOGAF is well-suited for large enterprises with complex structures, diverse business units, and extensive IT landscapes. The framework provides a structured methodology for managing complexity and aligning business and IT objectives.

- *Industry Standards and Compliance*: In industries where there are established standards and compliance requirements for enterprise architecture, TOGAF can be a valuable tool. It aligns with industry best practices and provides a common language for architecture development.

- *Enterprise-wide Transformation*: Organizations undergoing significant transformations, such as mergers, acquisitions, or large-scale technology changes, can benefit from TOGAF. The framework provides a systematic approach to aligning business and IT strategies during periods of change.

- *Consistent Architecture Approach*: If an organization seeks a standardized approach to architecture development, TOGAF offers a comprehensive and systematic methodology. This can help ensure consistency in how architectures are designed, documented, and implemented across the enterprise.

- *Long-term Planning*: TOGAF supports long-term planning by providing a structured approach to developing and managing enterprise architectures. It helps organizations create a roadmap for future developments and ensures that these developments align with business goals.

- *Stakeholder Communication*: TOGAF emphasizes the importance of stakeholder engagement and communication. In contexts where there are numerous stakeholders with diverse interests, TOGAF can help facilitate communication and ensure that everyone is aligned with the enterprise's goals.

- *IT Governance*: Organizations that prioritize effective IT governance can find TOGAF beneficial. The framework provides governance structures and processes to ensure that IT initiatives align with business strategies and comply with organizational policies.

- *Training and Skill Development*: If an organization is committed to developing a workforce with skills in enterprise architecture, TOGAF provides a widely recognized certification program. This can be valuable for individuals and organizations seeking to enhance their architecture capabilities.


## Can you pass the exams by memorizing the answers from the practice tests? 

Continuing on the same comical and ignorant manner, as with the preconceptions I describe above, I really thought this is the case.

I thought I will just quickly check a box for my CV and put it to rest, forget about it, and move on.

I was wrong.

Long story short, the exam can be passed rather easily within one month period of effort investment, but there is no way in which one can memorize the questions and answers and just move on.

The exam has to parts: 

1. a theoretical part, consisting of 40 questions, in which yes, you can find similar questions in the practice tests, but I can guarantee this will not give you a 100% successful pass rate. You need to understand the logic of the framework, and you need to understand the context in which the questions are asked. It can be very easy to mix and match the answers.

2. a practical part, consisting of 8 complex questions, in which you are given a scenario. In this exam, one is allowed in with the material support. This is the part where you cannot rely on memorization. You need to understand the concepts, and you need to understand the context in which they are applied.


## How can you prepare for the exams?

As each person learns differently, you can choose:

- online trainings, learning at your own pace, but be aware, they will mainly read the framework for you, no further explanations ex: [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/togaf-10-practitioner/learn/lecture/41159988?start=1#overview)

- reading the materials from the Open Group website: [TOGAF Library](https://publications.opengroup.org/togaf-library)

- investing in a more expensive training, with an accredited trainer, and with a group of people, which can be more engaging, letting someone else structure and highlight the information for you, ex: [Advised skills](https://www.advisedskills.com/)

- practice tests, which can be found online on [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/togaf-practice-test/) or [examtopics](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/the-open-group/)


## Ending Note

On the ending note, I was pleasantly surprised, to discover there are no enforced waterfall processes, no ivory towers, no dictating of solutions, no heavy documentation, no heavy processes, no heavy governance, no heavy anything. 

It is all about common sense, and it is all about tailoring the framework to your own needs.

That is why I decided to share my own experience, and my own thoughts on the matter.

Weather it can help you or not, it is up to you to decide. You know better your own context and your own needs.
