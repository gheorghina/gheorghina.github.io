### Workshops

#### Architecture & Software Design for Solving Business Problems

For a good amount of years I have been exposed to the context of having to both shape technical concepts for new potential products, but also to define technical strategies and drive the technical initiatives across complex projects.

After doing it for a couple of years I decided to document my thinking process and to also do some workshops with my fellow colleagues for knowledge dissemination and teaching purposes. 

Reach out if you'd like me if you are interested in hands-on workshops for your teams.
