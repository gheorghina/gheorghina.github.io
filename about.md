Hi,

I am Gheorghina, a results-driven, versatile Principal Software Engineer with 15+ years of progressive experience managing large, global, and continuously evolving technical initiatives, while ensuring transformational, cost-effective, and quality delivery. 

I have demonstrated ability in developing / nurturing strong relationships with internal and external stakeholders, managing value delivery, and continuous change, while driving business process transformation. 

I have proven track record of managing multiple enterprise-wide IT initiatives from vision to benefits realization in various industries: home automation, big pharma, cloud collaboration, banking and logistics.

I am recognized for the ability to leverage technology to solve problems, streamline processes, and implement solutions through creation of innovative digital solutions. 

I am experienced in the strategic detail planning, execution, and leadership of enterprise-wide technology initiatives, which support business goals, deliver continuous improvement, and enhance productivity levels.  

Even though I don't find it mandatory to work with a single dedicate framework, I do consider some support better than others both the developer productivity and the product needs in terms of simplicity, fast and reliable releases while being flexible towards change and resilient towards faults. 

Nowadays I am trying to continuously grow on the technical side while also trying to bring positive customer impact through the solutions me and the teams I collaborate with build.  

In this blog I will mainly keep my notes but I will also try to write advices and recommendations that may also help you.

Leave a comment if you see areas in which improvements can be made.

Thank you!
