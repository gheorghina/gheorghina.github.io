Hi,

My name is Gheorghina.

I have experience in creating integration, distributed event driven backend solutions and web enterprise software applications while helping other colleagues grow.

I started my tech career in March 2008, and I continued working with Microsoft solutions for more than 9 years, after which I found a really nice opportunity which allowed me to switch from .net to elixir, allowing me to cultivate my passion and curiosity on distributed systems. 

From business perspective, I worked on designing and developing solutions for pharmaceutical, home automation, cloud communication and fintech areas. 

Since 2013 I was involved in presales, software architecture and tech leading activities for redesigning a suite of complex backend solutions in order to reduce maintenance costs, for ensuring the system's scalability and ability to cope with load.   

Even though I don't find it critical to work with a single dedicate framework, I do consider some technologies support better than others both the developer activities and the product needs in terms of simplicity, fast and reliable releases while being flexible towards change. 

The primary languages and technologies I have experience with are: the Microsoft Tech Stack, Elixir, JavaScript.

The primary tools I worked with are: Search Engines

The Cloud Provider I mainly used was AWS.
 
You may also find here articles on Ansible and Terraform.

Nowadays I am trying to continuously grow on the technical side while also trying to bring positive customer impact through the solutions me and my team builds.  

In this blog I will mainly keep my notes but I will also try to write advices and recommendations that may also help you.

Thank you!
