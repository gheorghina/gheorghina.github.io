Hi everyone

I am Gheorghina, an experienced technical lead and coach with over nine years of experience in creating integration, backend and web enterprise software applications while helping other colleagues grow. 

I have expertise in Full Stack Microsoft Solutions, JavaScript, Solr Search Engine and Ansible that were used in the home automation and in the pharmaceutical businesses. 

In the last two years I focused my activities in the Software Architecture area, but then I decided to broaden my technical and business expertise, so I went back on being a novice. 

Nowadays I am working a lot with Elixir, AWS and Terraform, specializing in the communication business.

In this blog I will mainly keep my notes but I will also try to write advices and recommendations that may also help you.

Thank you!
