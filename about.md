Hi,

My name is Gheorghina.

I have experience in creating integration, distributed event driven backend solutions and web enterprise software applications while helping other colleagues grow.

For a good amount of years I focused my activities mainly on designing systems at the architectural level by being involved in presales activities and in redesigning a suite of complex backend solutions for reducing maintenance costs.   

The primary languages and technologies I have experience with are: the Microsoft Tech Stack, Elixir, JavaScript, Search Engines and AWS that were used in the home automation, pharmaceutical and in the cloud communication businesses.

My languages of choice for configuration and infrastructure as a code are Ansible and Terraform.

Nowadays I am trying to continuously grow on the technical side while also trying to bring positive customer impact through the solutions me and my team builds.  

In this blog I will mainly keep my notes but I will also try to write advices and recommendations that may also help you.

Thank you!
