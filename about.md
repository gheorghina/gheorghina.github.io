Hi,

I am Gheorghina, a passionate, results driven Principal Software Engineer / Solution Architect with 16+ years of engineering experience out of which 9+ in leading and managing large technical initiatives across multiple teams(5-25 teams).

Designed and implemented technical solutions across various industries: Home Automation, Big Pharma, Cloud Collaboration, Banking and Logistics. 

Some of the solutions were designed in highly secure and regulated environments, some solutions were heavily supporting IOT with high throughput and low latency.

I am doing Software Architecture since over a decade. I am diving into Python, I fell in love with Elixir, I did C#. I am eager to learn new things while dragging others in the process. I love science, gardening, coffee & to travel.

In this blog I will mainly keep my notes but I will also try to write advices and recommendations that may also help you.

Leave a comment if you see areas in which improvements can be made.

Thank you!
