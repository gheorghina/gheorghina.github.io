Hi,

My name is Gheorghina.

I have experience in creating integration, backend and web enterprise software applications while helping other colleagues grow. 

I have expertise in Full Stack Microsoft Solutions and Search Engines that were used in the home automation and in the pharmaceutical businesses. 

I grew up to a point when I focused my activities mainly in providing Software Architecture solutions, but after that I decided to broaden my technical and business expertise, so I went back on being a novice. 

These days I am coding solutions based on Elixir and AWS wherever they make sense and bring value.

My languages of choice for configuration and infrastructure as a code are Ansible and Terraform.  

In this blog I will mainly keep my notes but I will also try to write advices and recommendations that may also help you.

Thank you!
