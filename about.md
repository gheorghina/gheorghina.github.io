Hi everyone

I am Gheorghina, a passionate technical lead and coach with over nine years of experience in creating integration, backend and web enterprise software applications while helping other colleagues grow. 

I have expertise in Full Stack Microsoft Solutions, JavaScript, Solr Search Engine and Ansible that were used in the home automation and in the pharmaceutical businesses. 

In the last couple of years I focused my activities in the Software Architecture area, but then I decided to broaden my technical expertise, so I went back on being a novice. 

Nowadays I am working a lot with Elixir, AWS and Terraform.

In this blog I will mainly keep my notes but I will also try to write advices and recommendations that may also help you.


Thank you!
